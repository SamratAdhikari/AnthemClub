How often came from the mouths Of Osman's barbarian nation Over the corpses of our defeated army A victory song! How often did your own son agress My homeland, upon your breast, And you became because of your own sons Your own sons' funeral urn! The fugitive hid, and towards him The sword reached into his cave Looking everywhere he could not find His home in his homeland Climbs the mountain, descends the valley Sadness and despair his companions Sea of blood beneath his feet Ocean of flame above. Castle stood, now a heap of stones Happiness and joy fluttered, Groans of death, weeping Now sound in their place. And Ah! Freedom does not bloom From the blood of the dead, Torturous slavery's tears fall From the burning eyes of the orphans! Pity, O Lord, the Hungarians Who are tossed by waves of danger Extend over it your guarding arm On the sea of its misery Long torn by ill fate Bring upon it a time of relief They who have suffered for all sins Of the past and of the future! https://lyricstranslate.com"

Argentina,AR,ARG,South_America,"Mortals! Hear the sacred cry: Freedom, freedom, freedom! Hear the noise of broken chains, see noble Equality enthroned. Rises to the heights of the Earth a new and glorious nation, its head crowned with laurels, and at her feet lying a Lion. May the laurels be eternal, the ones we managed to win Let us live crowned with glory or swear to die gloriously From the new Champions their faces Mars himself seems to encourage Greatness nestles in their bodies: at their march they make everything tremble. The dead Inca are shaken, and in their bones the ardour revives which renews their children of the Motherland the ancient splendour. Mountain ranges and walls are felt to resound with horrible din: the whole country is disturbed by cries of revenge, of war and rage. In the fiery tyrants the envy spit the pestipherous bile; their bloody standard they rise provoking the most cruel combat. Don't you see them over Mexico and Quito throwing themselves with tenacious viciousness? And who they cry, bathed in blood, Potosí, Cochabamba and La Paz? Don't you see them over sad Caracas spreading mourning and weeping and death? Don't you see them devouring as wild animals all people who surrender to them? To you it dares, Argentines, the pride of the vile invader; your fields it steps on, retelling so many glories as winner. But the brave ones, that united swore their merry freedom to sustain, to those blood-thirsty tigers bold breasts they will know to oppose. The valiant Argentine to arms runs burning with determination and bravery, the war bugler, as thunder, in the fields of the South resounds. Buenos Ayres opposes, leading the people of the illustrious Union, and with robust arms they tear the arrogant Iberian lion. San José, San Lorenzo, Suipacha, both Piedras, Salta and Tucumán, La Colonia and the same walls of the tyrant in the Banda Oriental. They are eternal signboards they say: here the Argentine arm found triumph, here the fierce oppressor of the Motherland his proud neck bent. Victory to the Argentine warrior covered with its brilliant wings, and embarrassed at this view the tyrant with infamy took to flight. Its flags, its arms surrender as trophies to freedom, and above wings of glory the people rise the worthy throne of their great majesty. From one pole to the other resounds the fame of the sonorous bugler, and of America the name showing they repeat ""Mortals, hear: The United Provinces of the South have now displayed their most honorable throne"". And the free people of the world reply: ""We salute the great people of Argentina!"""

Brazil,BR,BRA,South_America,"The placid shores of the Ipiranga heard the resounding shout of a heroic folk And the sun of Liberty in shining beams shone in the homeland's sky at that instant If the pledge of this equality we managed to conquer with strong arm In thy bosom, O Freedom, our chest defies death itself!

Chile,CH,CHL,South_America,"Beloved Homeland, receive the vows That Chile gave you on your altars That you be either the tomb of the free Or a refuge from oppression The bloody fight has ceased; and yesterday's invader is now our brother; three centuries we washed the affront fighting in the field of honor. That who yesterday was a slave is free and triumphant today; freedom is the heritage of the brave, Victory lies shameful to his feet. Rise, Chile, with a spotless forehead; you conquered your name on the fight; always noble, constant and courageous the children of the Cid found you. May your free calmly crown the arts, industry and peace, and may they sing songs of your triumph to intimidate the daring despot. Your names, brave soldiers who have been Chile's mainstay, they are engraved in our chests; our children will know them as well. May they be the death cry that comes out when we march to the fight, and ringing in the mouth of the strong they always make the tyrant tremble. If the foreign cannon intends to invade, daring, our people; let's draw our arms and know victory or death. With its blood the proud Araucanian inherited its courage to us; and the sword doesn't tremble in the hand of that who defends the honor of Chile. How pure, Chile, is your blue sky And how pure the breezes that blow across you And your countryside embroidered with flowers Is a wonderful copy of Eden How majestic are the snow-covered mountains That were given to you by God as protection And the sea that tranquilly bathes your shores Promises future splendor for you hat pride, oh, Homeland!, those flowers growing on your fertile soil, may they never be stepped on by invaders; may your shadow cover them with peace. Our chests will be your bastion in your name we will know how to win, or your noble, glorious emblem will see us fall in the fight."
Colombia,CO,COL,South_America,"Oh, unwithering glory! Oh, immortal jubilance! In furrows of pain, goodness now germinates. The dreadful night has ceased. Sublime Liberty beams forth the dawn of her invincible light. All of humanity that groans within its chains, understands the words of He who died on the cross. ""Independence!"" shouts the American world; The land of Columbus. Is bathed in heroes' blood. But this great doctrine; ""The king is not the sovereign"", resounds, and those who suffer bless their passion. The Orinoco's bed Is heaped with plunder, Of blood and tears A river is seen to flow. neither souls nor eyes, know whether admiration to feel or fear to suffer. On the shores of the Caribbean, a famished people fight, preferring horror to fickle health. O, aye! from Cartagena heavy is the hardship, and death's rubble her virtue disdains From in the fields, the genius of glory, from every sprig a hero was crowned undefeated. Soldiers without armor won the victory; their virile spirit served them as a shield. Bolívar crosses the Andes bathed by two oceans, swords as though sparks flash in . Indomitable centaurs descend to the plains, and a premonition begins to be felt, of the epic's end. The victorious trumpet in Ayacucho loudly thunders, as in every triumph grows its formidable sound. In its expansive thrust Liberty is first felt, from the American sky forming a pavilion. In agony, the Virgin Tears out her hair, and bereft of her love, leaves it to hang on a cypress. Regretting her hope covered by a cold headstone, but glorious pride hallows her fair skin. Thus the motherland is formed, Thermopylaes bursting forth; a constellation of cyclops the night did brighten. The trembling flower finding the wind mortal, underneath the laurels safety sought. But it's not complete glory to defeat in battle, the arm that fights is encouraged by truth. For independence alone The great clamour doesn't silence; if the sun shines on everyone, justice is liberty. Of men the rights preaching, the soul of struggle was prophetically taught. Ricaurte in San Mateo, in atoms flying, ""Duty before life,"" with flames he wrote."
Ecuador,EC,ECU,South_America,"We greet you, Oh Fatherland, a thousand times! Oh Fatherland, Glory be to you! Glory be to you! Your breast, your breast, overflows, Your breast overflows with joy and peace; And your radiant face, your radiant face is brighter than the shining sun we see. Your children were outraged by the yoke That Iberian audacity imposed on you, By the unjust and horrendous disgrace Fatally weighing upon you. They cried out a holy voice to the heavens, that noble voice of a unbreakable pledge, to defeat that monster of blood, that this servile yoke would disappear. The first ones, the sons of the soil Which Pichincha adorns proudly, They declared you as their sovereign lady forever And shed their blood for you. God observed and accepted the holocaust, And that blood was the prolific seed Of other heroes whom the world in astonishment Saw rise up around you by the thousands. Rise up by the thousands, Rise up by the thousands. Of those heroes of iron arm No land was invincible, And from the valley to the highest sierra You could hear the roar of the fray. After the fray, Victory would fly, Freedom after the triumph would come, And the Lion was heard broken With a roar of helplessness and despair. At last Spanish ferocity yielded, And now, oh Fatherland, your free existence Is the noble and magnificent heritage Which the felicitous heroism gave us.: It was given to us from our Fathers' hands, Let no one take it from us now, Nor any daring fool wish to excite Our vengeful anger against himself. May no one, oh Fatherland, try it. The shadows of Your glorious heroes watch us, And the valor and pride that they inspire Are omens of victories for you. Come lead and the striking iron, That the idea of war and revenge Wakes the heroic strength That made the fierce Spanish succumb. And if new chains are prepared by The barbaric injustice of fate, Great Pichincha! May you prevent the death Of the country and their children in the end; Sink to the deep point in your gut All that exists on your soil. Let the tyrant Tread only ashes and in vain Look for any trace of being beside you."
Guyana,GY,GUY,South_America,"Dear land of Guyana, of rivers and plains Made rich by the sunshine, and lush by the rains, Set gem-like and fair, between mountains and seas, Your children salute you, dear land of the free. Green land of Guyana, our heroes of yore, Both bondsmen and free, laid their bones on your shore. This soil so they hallowed, and from them are we, All sons of one Mother, Guyana the free. Great land of Guyana, diverse though our strains, We're born of their sacrifice, heirs of their pains, And ours is the glory their eyes did not see, One land of six peoples, united and free. Dear land of Guyana, to you will we give, Our homage, our service, each day that we live; God guard you, great Mother, and make us to be More worthy our heritage, land of the free."
Paraguay,PY,PRY,South_America,"The peoples of the Americas, unfortunately, Were oppressed for three centuries by a scepter But one magnificent day surging forth, ""Enough!"", it said, and the scepter was broken. Our fathers, grandiose in battle, Showed their martial glory; And after smashing the august diadem, The triumphal cap was raised. Paraguayans: Republic or Death! Our spirit gave us liberty Neither oppressors nor slaves exist Where union and equality reign. A new Rome, the Fatherland shall proudly display Two leaders of name and valor Who, rivals, like Romulus and Remus Divided government and power. These long years when, during which Phoebus in the clouds Saw darken the pearl of the South, Today a grand hero appears Raising up again her glory and virtue, Europe and the entire world to her Gives salutes and also acclaimations To that invincible bastion of heroism, The magnificent Eden of riches. When discord rumbled all around Which fatally devoured other Peoples, Paraguayans, the sacred ground Was covered by an angel with its wings. Oh, how pure, of laurel girded Sweet Fatherland, in this manner you show yourself. In your ensign one sees the colors Of sapphire, diamond, and ruby. In your coat of arms, which the Sun illuminates, Under the cap, one sees the lion. Double image of the strong and the free, And of glories, the memory and crest. From the tomb of vile feudalism The national Deity rises free; Oppressors, bend your knees! Compatriots, entone the hymn! Sound the cry, ""Republic or death""! Our breasts exhale it with faith, And the mountains repeat its echoes Like giants arising in the land. Our Fatherland defends liberty and justice; So tyrants: listen! The laws in its sacred charter Will sustain its heroism in the fight. Against the world, if the world opposes it, If the world dares to insult her security, Battling to avenge we shall know her Or die embracing her. Arise, oh People, your splendid sword That strikes with sparkles of God, There is no middle ground between free or slave And an abyss divides the two. In the gentle breezes the Hymn resounds, Repeating with triumphal echo: For the free, renowned glory! For the Fatherland, immortal laurel!"
Peru,PE,PER,South_America,"We are free! May we always be so, may we always be so! And may the Sun renounce its light, its light, its light, Before we break the solemn vow which the homeland lifted up to the Eternal, Before we break the solemn vow which the homeland lifted up to the Eternal. Before we break the solemn vow which the homeland lifted up to the Eternal. For a long time the oppressed Peruvian the ominous chain he dragged Condemned to a cruel servitude for a long time, for a long time for a long time he quietly moaned But as soon as the sacred cry Freedom! in its coasts was heard the slaves' indolence shakes the humiliated, the humiliated, the humiliated neck raised up, the humiliated neck raised up, neck raised up We are free! May we always be so, may we always be so! And may the Sun renounce its light, its light, its light, Before we break the solemn vow which the homeland lifted up to the Eternal, Before we break the solemn vow which the homeland lifted up to the Eternal. Before we break the solemn vow which the homeland lifted up to the Eternal. Now the roar of rough chains that we had heard for three centuries of horror from the free, at the sacred cry that the world heard astonished, ceased. Everywhere the inflamed San Martín ""Freedom"", ""Freedom"" he pronounced; and the Andes, rocking their base, announced it as well, in unison. With its influx the peoples woke up, and like lighting ran the opinion; from the Isthmus to the Tierra del Fuego, and from Tierra del Fuego to the icy regions. Everyone vowed to break the link that Nature denied to both worlds, and break the sceptre that Spain had reclined, proudly, on both. Lima fulfilled this solemn vow, and, severe, its anger showed by throwing out the powerless tyrant, who had been trying to extend his oppression. On its endeavor the shackles cracked, and the furrows that it had repaired in itself stirred up its hatred and vengeance, inherited from its Inca and Lord. Countrymen, may we see it a slave no more. If for three centuries it moaned, humiliated, forever may we swear it'd be free, maintaining its own splendor. Our arms, until today unarmed, be they always readying the cannon, that some day the beaches of Iberia will feel the horror of its roar. May we arouse the jealousy of Spain since it has a premonition, with want and furor, that in a contest of great nations our country will enter in comparison. On the list formed by these we shall fill the line first, ahead of the ambitious Iberian tyrant, who devastated all of America. On its summits may the Andes sustain the two-color flag or standard, may it announce to the centuries the effort that being free, that being free that being free gave us forever. Under its shadow may we live calmly and, at birth of the sun in its summits, may we all renew the great oath that we rendered, that we rendered that we rendered to the God of Jacob, that we rendered to the God of Jacob, the God of Jacob. We are free! May we always be so, may we always be so! And may the Sun renounce its light, its light, its light, Before we break the solemn vow which the homeland lifted up to the Eternal, Before we break the solemn vow which the homeland lifted up to the Eternal. Before we break the solemn vow which the homeland lifted up to the Eternal."

Venezuela,VE,VEN,South_America,"Glory to the brave people which shook off the yoke, the Law respecting virtue and honour. Down with the chains! Cried out the Lord; and the poor man in his hovel for freedom implored. Upon this holy name trembled in fear the vile selfishness that had once triumphed.

Faithful countrymen, your strength lies in your unity; and from the heavens the supreme Creator breathed a sublime spirit into the nation.

United States of America,US,USA,North_America,"Oh, say can you see by the dawn's early light What so proudly we hailed at the twilight's last gleaming? Whose broad stripes and bright stars through the perilous fight, O'er the ramparts we watched were so gallantly streaming? And the rocket's red glare, the bombs bursting in air, Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. Oh, say does that star-spangled banner yet wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave? On the shore, dimly seen through the mists of the deep, Where the foe's haughty host in dread silence reposes, What is that which the breeze, o'er the towering steep, As it fitfully blows, half conceals, half discloses? Now it catches the gleam of the morning's first beam, In full glory reflected now shines in the stream: 'Tis the star-spangled banner! Oh long may it wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! And where is that band who so vauntingly swore That the havoc of war and the battle's confusion, A home and a country should leave us no more! Their blood has washed out their foul footsteps' pollution. No refuge could save the hireling and slave From the terror of flight, or the gloom of the grave: And the star-spangled banner in triumph doth wave O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave! Oh! thus be it ever, when freemen shall stand Between their loved home and the war's desolation! Blest with victory and peace, may the heav'n rescued land Praise the Power that hath made and preserved us a nation. Then conquer we must, when our cause it is just, And this be our motto: ""In God is our trust."" And the star-spangled banner in triumph shall wave Over the land of the free and the home of the brave!"

On the mount, in the vale The terrifying cannon thunder and the echoes nobly resound to the cries of union! liberty! Fatherland, before your children become unarmed Beneath the yoke their necks in sway, May your countryside be watered with blood, On blood their feet trample. And may your temples, palaces and towers crumble in horrid crash, and their ruins exist saying: The fatherland was made of one thousand heroes here. Fatherland, fatherland, your children swear to exhale their breath in your cause, If the bugle in its belligerent tone should call upon them to struggle with bravery. For you the olive garlands!

From your old and hard chains You forged, with an ire-driven hand, The plow that fertilizes the soil And the honor-saving sword. Our fathers fought one day, Lit up in patriotic burning And they managed, without bloody clash, To place you on a throne of love.

Your emblem is a piece of the sky From which a cloud gets its whiteness And woe onto him who dares in blind madness your colours to stain! For your sons, brave and zealous, who adore peace as a great treasure will never avoid the rough battle to defend their land and their home. They will never avoid the rough battle to defend their land and their home as well as the altar of the mother country, their altar. Lying upon the proud Ande, of the two oceans, hearing its noise, under the gold and crimson red wing of the beautiful quetzal you will become entranced.

Dominican Republic,DO,DOM,North_America,"Brave , Let’s raise our song with vivid emotion, From the world to the face of the earth Show our unconquered glorious banner. Hail, the nation who strong and intrepid, Into war launched itself set to die When in a warring challenge to the death Its chains of slavery still it cut off. No people deserves to be free If it’s an indolent slave and servile; If in its chest doesn't grow the flame that forged virile heroism. But the brave and indomitable Always proudly her forehead will raise For if she were a thousand times a slave This many times to be free she will know. And if fraud and cunning exposed her To disdain of an intrusive man, Las Carreras! Beler!...were fields Which covered in glory were seen. At the top of our heroic bastion, Word of the free was materialized, Where the genius of Sanchez and Duarte Taught us to be free or to die. And if could inconsiderate leader Reduce the luster of these glories, Of the war seen in Capotillo The banner of fire waves on. And the fire that leaves shocked The arrogant lion from Castile, Removes it from glorious beaches to Where floats the banner that’s crossed. Compatriots, let’s show erect our Forehead, proud of today for; will be destroyed But slave again, never. That every chest is of love a sanctuary Where one feels the homeland lives; It is the law her invincible shield; It is her motto be free or die. Liberty that still serenely lifts up Victory in her triumphal carriage. The trumpet of war still resounds Proclaiming her immortal glory Liberty! Let the echoes agitate While full of noble anxiety Our battlefields of glory repeat Liberty! Liberty! Liberty!"
Honduras,HN,HND,North_America,"Your flag, your flag is a piece of sky crossed, oh crossed by a dash of snow. And on its hallowed ground can be seen five stars of a pale blue. On your crest, that a clamorous sea shields with its roaring waves. Beyond a volcano, beyond a volcano its top bared there's a star, there's a star of radiant light.   Indian, virgin and beautiful you slept to the resounding chants of your sea, when, lying in your golden banks the bold navogator found you, and awe-struck at beholding your beauty under the perfect thrall of your charm, the blue hem of your splendid cape sanctified with his kiss of love.    Of a country where the sun rises, beyond the blue Atlantic, that man that had dreamed of you and set out to sea looking for you. When you raised your pale forehead, on the living anxiety of your longing, under the gentle dome of your sky a strange banner already floated.    It was useless that your beloved, the indian wrathfully prepared for the fight, because, his Lempirian blood wrapped around him he sunk into the depths of night. And of the epic deed, in his memory, only the legend has been kept, the place of its burial unknown to all and the stoic profile of a crag.    For three hundred your children heard the imperative call of the master, for three centuries your useless call got lost in the blue air. But one day, glory, your ear sensed that, powerful and distant, that far away, across the Atlantic, a lion roared in indignation.    It was France, the free, the heroic, that asleep in his centuries long dream, awakened, infuriated, to life at the virile call of Danton, it was France, that sent forth to death the head of the consecrated King, and that built, proud at its side the altar of the goddess Reason.    You too, o homeland! did rise of your deep, servile sleep and you, too, showed the world that laid in pieces the infamous link of your chain. And in your blessed soil, beyond the tall mane of the savage mountain, like a bird of black plumage, the short-lived colony was lost.    So as to keep this divine crest O homeland, we'll march into death. Our luck will be generous if we die while thinking of your love, defending your sacred flag. And many, Honduras, will be your dead wrapped up in your glorious folds, but all will fall with honor. https://lyricstranslate.com"

And with unwavering faith, the path of progress She strives to follow, to follow To fulfil Her greatest destiny And conquer a happy future. A stern barrier protects Her Against the clash of vile disloyalty, Ever since the day when Her soaring Flag, Wrote ""LIBERTY!"" with Its blood. Freedom is Her dogma and Her guide; A thousand times She has managed to defended it, And as many times She repelled The hateful power of atrocious tyranny. bloody and sad her story is, Yet at the same time sublime and brilliant, A source of legitimate glory And a great lesson in spartan pride. Her innate bravery does not waver: In every man there is an immortal hero Who will know how to keep himself up to The proverbial valor of old. Proverbial valor. Proverbial valor. All are devoted and faithful To the tradition of warlike bravery With which they have always reaped fame By saving the Motherland's honour. To respect the rights of others And base Her actions on right and justice Is for Her, without infamous trickery, The constant and most firm ambition. And in following this line She persists, Dedicating her tenacious efforts In waging hard war to war; Her fortune is found in peace. Is found in peace. Is found in peace."

Why the anger, why the rage? This blood of ours which we shed for you shall not be blessed otherwise; For Freedom is the absolute right of my God-worshiping nation.I have been free since the beginning and forever shall be so. What madman shall put me in chains! I defy the very idea! I'm like the roaring flood; powerful and independent, I'll tear apart mountains, exceed the heavens and still gush out! The lands of the West may be armored with walls of steel, But I have borders guarded by the mighty chest of a believer. Recognize your innate strength, my friend! And think: how can this fiery faith ever be killed, By that battered, single-fanged monster you call ""civilization""?My friend! Leave not my homeland to the hands of villainous men! Render your chest as armor and your body as trench! Stop this disgraceful rush! For soon shall come the joyous days of divine promise... Who knows? Perhaps tomorrow? Perhaps even sooner!View not the soil you tread on as mere earth - recognize it! And think about the shroudless thousands who lie so nobly beneath you. You're the noble son of a martyr, take shame, hurt not your ancestor! Unhand not, even when you're promised worlds, this paradise of a homeland.What man would not die for this heavenly piece of land? Martyrs would gush out should one simply squeeze the soil! Martyrs! May God take my life, all my loved ones and possessions from me if He will, But may He not deprive me of my one true homeland for the world. Oh glorious God, the sole wish of my pain-stricken heart is that, No heathen's hand should ever touch the bosom of my sacred Temples. These adhans, whose shahadahs are the foundations of my religion, May their noble sound last loud and wide over my eternal homeland.For only then, shall my fatigued tombstone, if there is one, prostrate a thousand times in ecstasy, And tears of fiery blood shall flow out of my every wound, And my lifeless body shall gush out from the earth like an eternal spirit, Perhaps only then, shall I peacefully ascend and at long last reach the heavens.So ripple and wave like the bright dawning sky, oh thou glorious crescent, So that our every last drop of blood may finally be blessed and worthy! Neither you nor my race shall ever be extinguished! For freedom is the absolute right of my ever-free flag; For independence is the absolute right of my God-worshiping nation!"

Unite the sea and the springs, Unite the steppe and the forest! Hail, mother Africa, Hail, mother Africa!

We are a straight people-the sword has no fault. S??al, we make your great design our own: To gather the chicks, sheltering them from kites, To make from them, from East to West, from North to South, A people rising as one, in seamless unity, Yet a people facing all the winds of the earth. S??al, like thee, like all our heroes, We will be stern without hatred, and with open arms. The sword we will put peacefully in its sheath, For work and words will be our weapon.
